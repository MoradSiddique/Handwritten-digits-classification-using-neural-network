# Handwritten-digits-classification-using-neural-network

I'm going to work through a series of simple neural network architectures and compare their performance on the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.take an input image (28x28 pixels) of a handwritten single digit (0â€“9) and classify the image as the appropriate digit.Here are some examples of the images in the dataset:
